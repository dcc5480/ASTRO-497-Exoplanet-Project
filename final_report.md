## Contributions
I created a Jupyter notebook, designed to be a convenient user interface to gather and clean Kepler lightcurve data, fit a BLS model to the data, visualize each step of the process, and determine the period and radius of one or multiple planets that are detected along with how well the model fits.

## Next Steps
The dashboard has much room for improvement, as it is often difficult to find planets, the model seems to have some issues fitting the data even when planets are found, and assessment of the goodness of fit should be made more rigorous. Otherwise, further refining the model and allowing more data to be used at once could allow for far more satisfactory results from the data analysis.

## Reflection
This experience has taught me much about the process of data analysis and building a user interface, particularly that it can be a long and arduous process. In addition, I often found it difficult to find information about how to complete certain tasks, such as using a box least squares model. Overall, I have learned that projects such as this require time management skills and a decent understanding of the subjects being used, as they are time consuming and difficult to get working properly even with a proper understanding about what should be going on.

## Project Suggestions
I am not sure how my experience would have differed if I had completed this project with a group, though I do expect that I would have adhered more strongly to the deadlines as my obligation would have been to more than just myself. Perhaps it would be beneficial to further encourage working in groups, though I am not confident either way.

Additionally, it may be helpful to provide further support or lessons on how to find the necessary information for completing a project, such as strategies for researching niche topics like lightcurve models, as this was a difficult part of the process.

## Other Suggestions
In general, I believe that the course would be more engaging if student participation in the lectures was increased somewhat. I do think that the top hat questions helped with engagement, but they were not completed in person or as a class.

At times, it was unclear to me what I needed to thoroughly understand and what was more secondary, for example the relativistic corrections for orbital motion. Perhaps having a list of key concepts or some other sort of guide could help prevent this confusion.
